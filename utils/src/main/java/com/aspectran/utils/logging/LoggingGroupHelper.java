/**
 * Utility class for managing a logical "logging group" identifier in the
 * SLF4J Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).
 * <p>
 * A logging group is a string that ties a sequence of log events together
 * (for example, per HTTP request, background job, or user session). Because
 * many logging backends write asynchronously and application servers often
 * reuse threads from pools, removing the key too early may cause late log
 * events to be written without the expected context, or may leave the key
 * associated with a thread that is reused for the next task. To avoid leaks
 * and missing context, set the logging group at the beginning of the unit of
 * work and clear it in a finally block.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * try {
 *     LoggingGroupHelper.set("request-12345");
 *     // perform work and write logs
 * } finally {
 *     LoggingGroupHelper.clear();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Thread-safety note: MDC stores values per-thread. When using executors or
 * reactive frameworks, you may need to propagate the MDC to child threads
 * explicitly depending on the MDC implementation and runtime environment.
 *
 * @see org.slf4j.MDC
