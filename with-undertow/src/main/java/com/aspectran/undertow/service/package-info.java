/**
 * Provides the core service for handling requests in an embedded Undertow environment.
 * This package contains the primary service interface, {@code com.aspectran.undertow.service.TowService},
 * and its implementations. These components form the heart of the request processing pipeline when
 * running Aspectran on an embedded Undertow server without the overhead of the full Servlet API.
 * This lightweight, non-servlet approach offers a high-performance alternative for handling
 * HTTP requests directly.
