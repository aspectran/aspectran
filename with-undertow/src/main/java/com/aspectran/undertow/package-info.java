/**
 * Provides integration for using Undertow as the embedded web server for Aspectran applications.
 * <p>This package enables Aspectran to run as a high-performance, Servlet-less web framework
 * on top of Undertow. It includes core components for adapting Undertow's native
 * {@code HttpServerExchange} objects to Aspectran's processing pipeline, offering a
 * lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional Servlet-based deployments.</p>
