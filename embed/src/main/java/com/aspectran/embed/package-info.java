/**
 * Provides the core classes for embedding Aspectran within another Java application.
 * <p>This package defines the top-level entry points and utility classes for integrating
 * Aspectran as a library or component. It offers a simplified facade,
 * {@link com.aspectran.embed.service.EmbeddedAspectran}, to interact with the framework
 * programmatically, allowing developers to leverage Aspectran's features without
 * needing to manage its full lifecycle directly.</p>
