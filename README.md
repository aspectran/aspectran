Aspectran is a framework for developing Java applications that can be used to build simple shell applications and large enterprise web applications.

Aspectran consists of the following key features:

* **Support POJO (*Plain Old Java Object*) programming model**  
  The complexity of the framework and the complexity of the detailed technology should not be passed on to developers.
  Developers can implement the functionality in a simple Java class and return the resulting value in a Java base object.
* **Support Inversion of Control (*IoC*)**  
  The framework completes the overall functionality by directly invoking the unit functionality implemented by the developer while controlling the overall flow.
  The framework manages the creation and lifecycle of objects so that developers can focus on business logic.
* **Support Dependency Injection (*DI*)**  
  The framework links modules that depend on each other at runtime.
  It can maintain low coupling between modules and increase code reusability.
* **Support Aspect-Oriented Programming (*AOP*)**  
  The framework combines additional functionality such as transactions, logging, security, and exception handling within the core logic implemented by the developer.
  Developers will be able to code the core and add-ons separately.
* **Support building RESTful Web Services**  
  Aspectran is designed from the ground up to be suitable for implementing REST APIs, eliminating the need for a separate framework or additional libraries.
  Intuitive API implementation allows you to send and receive messages in a consistent format quickly.
* **Fast development and startup time**  
  Aspectran's intuitive programming model ensures fast development and start-up time.

Applications developed based on Aspectran support the following execution environments on the JVM:

* Consistent shell interface for command line applications
* Built-in high performance web application server (Undertow, Jetty)
* Daemons running as background processes
