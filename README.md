Aspectran is a framework for developing Java applications that can be used to build simple shell applications and large enterprise web applications.

The key features of Aspectran are:

* **Support POJO (*Plain Old Java Object*) programming model**  
  Developers do not need to know the heavy and complex objects used internally by the framework. They can exchange objects with the framework using simple Java classes.
* **Support Inversion of Control (*IoC*)**  
  What's more, the framework manages the creation and lifecycle of objects while controlling the overall flow, freeing developers to focus on their business logic.
* **Support Dependency Injection (*DI*)**  
  The framework systematically connects modules that depend on each other at runtime to ensure low coupling between modules and to increase code reusability.
* **Support Aspect-Oriented Programming (*AOP*)**  
  The framework combines additional features such as transactions, logging, security, and exception handling with code written by the developer at runtime.
* **Support building RESTful Web Services**  
  Aspectran is a framework designed from the ground up for REST API implementations and optimized for microservices architectures.
* **Fast development and startup time**  
  Aspectran's intuitive programming model guarantees fast development time and runs faster than other frameworks.

Aspectran-based applications support the following execution environments on the JVM:

* Consistent shell interface for command line applications
* Built-in high performance web application server (Undertow, Jetty)
* Daemons running as background processes
