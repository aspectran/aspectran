/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for internationalization (i18n) support, allowing
 * applications to resolve text messages for different locales.
 * 
 * <p>The central interface in this package is {@link com.aspectran.core.support.i18n.message.MessageSource},
 * which provides a standard way to resolve messages. The {@link com.aspectran.core.support.i18n.message.HierarchicalMessageSource}
 * sub-interface adds support for nested message resolution, allowing message sources
 * to be arranged in a parent-child hierarchy.
 * 
 * <p>The primary implementation is {@link com.aspectran.core.support.i18n.message.ResourceBundleMessageSource},
 * which resolves messages from standard Java {@link java.util.ResourceBundle} files.
