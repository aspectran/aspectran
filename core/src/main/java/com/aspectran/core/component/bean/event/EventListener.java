/**
 * Annotation that marks a method as a listener for an application event.
 *
 * <p>The annotated method must have exactly one parameter, which is the event to
 * be handled. The container will inspect beans for this annotation and register
 * them as listeners for the specific event type declared in the method signature.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Component
 * public class MyEventListener {
 *
 *     &#064;EventListener
 *     public void handleOrderCompleted(OrderCompletedEvent event) {
 *         // ... logic to handle the event
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
